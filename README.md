# mealCrave

## Why?
Craving a dish but not sure where to go?  Find out with mealCrave.  Users can use this web app to search for a meal they just have-to-have and then find out where to go to get it.

## How?
Search results first and foremost prioritize images of dishes taken by other users.  Advertising for a particular restaurant is not the goal. The most apetizing picture wins.  Registered users contribute dishes by taking quality photos of their meal (hey, we do it for Instagram already anyway!).  Once the user adds several pertinent details like which restaurant they are at, the menu price, whether the meal is gluten free or vegatarian, etc.  the post becomes searchable by other users.  Posts are even editable after the fact by the user that created them.

## Want to Try?
